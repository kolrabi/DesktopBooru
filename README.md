# What is it?

DesktopBooru is a little tool I wrote for managing my image files. It supports assigning arbitrary tags to images, videos, animated images, and archives containing images. It also allows searching for files based on these tags and voting on images.

Tags can be assigned manually or (if images exist there) imported from Gelbooru and Danbooru.

## Requirements

This is a Mono project based on Gtk3 (gtk-sharp, cairo-sharp) and Sqlite (Mono.Data.Sqlite).
